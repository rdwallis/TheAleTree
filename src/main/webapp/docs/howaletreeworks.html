			<h1>How The Ale Tree Works</h1>
			<p>This is a simple guide to how the Ale Tree works.<br/>
			Read on to find out how votes are counted and how content gets to the front page.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
		<p>The principle idea behind the Ale Tree is that users are divided into teams before they vote, post links or comment.</p>
		<p>The action is only performed if other members of their team agree with the action.</p>
		<p>This stops collusion and spam because users can't choose their teammates.</p>
		<h2>Everyone's anonymous</h2>
		<p>Although we do log IP addresses to avoid duplicate votes, you'll never know who posted a link or comment.  In this way content must survive on its own merits and is not affected by who posted it.</p>
		<p>This also means that new users have exactly the same chance of getting a post to the front page as anyone else.</p>
		<h2>We're Open Source</h2>
